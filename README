Simple vagrant/puppet/virtualbox setup for provisioning a jenkins build server.  The initial basebox is sourced from http://www.vagrantbox.es/.

	CentOS 6.4 x86_64 Minimal (VirtualBox Guest Additions 4.2.16, Chef 11.6.0, Puppet 3.2.3)

puppet/manifests/jenkins.pp provisions stuff like...
	* jdk
	* nodejs/npm/grunt-cli
	* firewall port forward (host 8080 -> vbox 8080)

note: initial use will import the basebox over http, will take several minutes

Import and provision the virtual

	vagrant up

	http://localhost:8080    to verify jenkins is running

Log into the virtual and verify stuff has been installed

	vagrant ssh

	run node, npm and grunt from shell to verify install/symlinks (in /usr/local/bin)

Suspend the virtual (fast resume)

	vagrant suspend
	...
	vagrant resume ('vagrant up' works too)

Graceful shutdown

	vagrant halt

Done with the virtual for a while... delete it

	vagrant destroy
